## Command Extension
This mod is designed to enhance your gaming experience by allowing you to enter commands directly into the game’s chat box. It operates alongside the game’s existing command system, but with its own unique command prefix.  

**Here’s how to use it:**

* **Open the game’s chat box:**
This is typically done by pressing a specific key or button in the game. The chat box is where you’ll be entering your commands.
* **Enter your command:** Commands for the game itself start with a `/` prefix, while commands for the mod use a `!` prefix. For example, if you want to use a command from the mod, you would type something like `!pause`.
* **Execute the command:** After typing your command into the chat box, simply press enter. If the text you entered is a recognized command, it will be executed. If it’s not a recognized command, it will be sent as a regular chat message.
